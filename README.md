# theplug
The Plug is a social enterprise programme that aims to supply technology needs to the underserved. Its mission is to bridge the growing digital divide by collecting and fixing old and broken devices through a network of donation channels, in collaboration with partners and sponsors, ensuring that they arrive in the hands of our recipients in perfect working condition.  By giving these devices new life and redistributing them to those who cannot afford them, the programme also hopes to help reduce electronic waste.  Devices that we are not able to fix will be sent out to be recycled/upcycled as much as possible. We do this in partnership with other programmes and organisations that align with our mission and vision.
